Niels needs to do less
bram feels bad because no work
We're doing well at the moment

Niels:
First two weeks jank, because I did a lot and there was no real collaboration
This week it is better because there where more (small) tasks
Maybe make more smaller tasks instead of one or two big ones so evryone can get their hours
